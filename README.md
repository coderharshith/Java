# Variables in java
        ***
        *variables in Java language are the names used to refer to data stored in the memory
        *One Java variable can hold only a single type of data.
        *Before using a variable while programming, it is necessary to declare a variable.
        *It means to assign data to a particular memory and use a name for that memory.

# Datatypes in Java
    ** 
    8-Primitive:-
        1.byte :- The byte is the smallest data type among all the integer data types  It is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. It stores whole numbers ranging from -128 to 127.
        Syntax: byte var_byte = 6 ;

        2.short:- Short is a 16-bit signed two’s complement integer. It stores whole numbers with values ranging from -32768 to 32767. Its default value is 0.
        Syntax: var_short = 8;

        3.char

        4.boolean:- A boolean data type can store either True or False. They can be used to check whether two values are equal or not (basically in conditional statements to return True or False). Typically, programmers use it as a flag variable to track true or false conditions.
        Syntax:- 

        5.int :- Int is a 32-bit signed two’s complement integer that stores integral values ranging from 2147483648 (-2^31) to 2147483647 (2^31 -1). Its default value is 0.
        Syntax:- int var_int = 10;

        6.long :- long is a 64-bit signed two’s complement integer It is used when we need a range of values more than those provided by int. Its default value is 0L. This data type ends with ‘L’ or ‘l’.
        Syntax:- long var_long = 100000000l;


        7.float :- It is a floating-point data type that stores the values, including their decimal precision. It is not used for precise data such as currency or research data. ends with an ‘f’ or ‘F’.
        Syntax:- float var_float = 12.5f;

        8.double:- The double data type is similar to float. The difference between the two is that is double twice the float in the case of decimal precision. It is used for decimal values just like float and should not be used for precise values.
        Syntax:- double var_double = 20.20d;


    5-Non-Primitive:-
        1.string
        2.array
        3.class
        4.object
        5.interface
